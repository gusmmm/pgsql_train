# PostgreSQL for Healthcare Informatics: Setup Tutorial

This tutorial is designed for healthcare professionals with intermediate knowledge of data science and healthcare informatics. By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional PostgreSQL database environment for your healthcare data projects.

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up PostgreSQL and pgAdmin using Docker containers
- How to configure the database connection using environment variables for security
- How to connect to the database from Python and test the connection
- Simple examples of how this setup can help with healthcare informatics projects

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with command line interfaces
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Python 3.12 or later installed
- Basic understanding of databases and SQL
- Intermediate knowledge of Python programming

## Part 1: Setting Up Docker Containers

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pgsql_train.git
cd pgsql_train
```

### Step 2: Understanding the Docker Compose File

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines two services:

1. **PostgreSQL database server** - Stores your healthcare data securely
2. **pgAdmin web interface** - Provides a user-friendly way to manage your database

Take a look at the file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: pgsql_train
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: theuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: thepassword
      POSTGRES_DB: thedb
    ports:
      - "8700:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - pgsql_train_network

  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    container_name: pgsql_train_pgadmin
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@admin.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: admin
    ports:
      - "8701:80"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    networks:
      - pgsql_train_network

volumes:
  postgres_data:

networks:
  pgsql_train_network:
    driver: bridge
```

This file:
- Creates a PostgreSQL database server with a default user, password, and database
- Sets up a pgAdmin web interface for easy database management
- Creates a Docker network for secure communication between containers
- Configures a persistent volume to ensure your data isn't lost when containers restart

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables for Security

Instead of hardcoding database credentials, create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```bash
# Create a .env file
touch .env
```

Add the following content to your `.env` file:

```
# PostgreSQL Database Configuration
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=8700
POSTGRES_DB=thedb
POSTGRES_USER=theuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=thepassword
POSTGRES_MAX_RETRIES=5
POSTGRES_RETRY_DELAY=2
```

For a production environment, you should:
1. Use strong, unique passwords
2. Consider using environment-specific .env files (e.g., .env.development, .env.production)
3. Never commit your .env file to version control (add it to .gitignore)

### Step 4: Start the Docker Containers

Launch both the PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin web interface:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command:
- Downloads the necessary Docker images if they're not already available
- Creates the containers based on your docker-compose.yml configuration
- Starts the containers in detached mode (-d), so they run in the background

### Step 5: Verify the Containers Are Running

Check that both containers are running properly:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see both `pgsql_train` (PostgreSQL) and `pgsql_train_pgadmin` (pgAdmin) containers in the list with "Up" status.

### Step 6: Access pgAdmin Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8701
```

Login with:
- Email: `admin@admin.com`
- Password: `admin`

### Step 7: Connect pgAdmin to Your PostgreSQL Server

1. In pgAdmin, right-click on "Servers" and select "Create" → "Server..."
2. In the "General" tab, give your connection a name (e.g., "Healthcare Data")
3. Switch to the "Connection" tab and enter:
   - Host name/address: `postgres` (the service name in docker-compose.yml)
   - Port: `5432` (the default PostgreSQL port inside the container)
   - Maintenance database: `thedb`
   - Username: `theuser`
   - Password: `thepassword`
4. Click "Save"

You should now be connected to your PostgreSQL database.

## Part 2: Python Environment Setup and Database Connection

### Step 1: Setup Python Environment

This project requires Python 3.12 or later. If you don't have it installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install the required packages:

```bash
# If using pip
pip install psycopg2-binary python-dotenv

# Or if using the project's pyproject.toml
pip install -e .

# Or if using uv (as mentioned in the README)
uv sync
```

### Step 2: Understanding the Python Code Structure

The project has a simple structure:

```
pgsql_train/
├── database/
│   ├── __init__.py     # Exports the PostgresConnection class
│   └── dbmanager.py    # Contains the PostgresConnection class definition
├── tutorial/
│   └── how to setup.md # This tutorial
├── .env                # Environment variables (credentials)
├── docker-compose.yml  # Docker configuration
├── main.py             # Example script using the database connection
├── pyproject.toml      # Project dependencies
└── README.md           # Project overview
```

### Step 3: Explore the Database Connection Code

The database connection is handled by the `PostgresConnection` class in `database/dbmanager.py`. This class:

1. Loads environment variables from the `.env` file
2. Creates a connection to the PostgreSQL database
3. Provides methods to test the connection and display database information

Key features of this class:

- **Environment-based configuration**: Uses variables from `.env` file for security
- **Connection retry mechanism**: Automatically retries if connection fails
- **Comprehensive testing**: Verifies and displays connection details

### Step 4: Run the Connection Test

Run the example script to test the database connection:

```bash
python main.py
```

If successful, you'll see output similar to:

```
Attempting to connect to PostgreSQL (Attempt 1/5)...
Connection established successfully!

==================================================
DATABASE CONNECTION INFORMATION
==================================================
PostgreSQL Version: PostgreSQL 16.1 (Debian 16.1-1.pgdg120+1)...
Connected Database: thedb
Connected User: theuser
Database Size: 8553 kB
Connection Parameters:
  - Host: localhost
  - Port: 8700
  - Database: thedb
  - User: theuser
==================================================

Connection to PostgreSQL was successful!
Database connection closed.
```

### Step 5: Understanding How the Code Works

The key components of the connection process:

1. **Loading environment variables**:
   ```python
   from pathlib import Path
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   
   # Load environment variables from .env file
   env_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / '.env'
   load_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_path)
   ```

2. **Creating the database connection**:
   ```python
   from database import PostgresConnection
   
   # Create connection using environment variables
   db = PostgresConnection()
   
   # Connect to the database
   db.connect()
   ```

3. **Testing the connection**:
   ```python
   # Test connection and display information
   db.test_connection()
   ```

```python
def save_patient_data(db_connection, patient_id, vital_signs):
    """Save patient vital signs to database."""
    cursor = db_connection.cursor()
    
    # SQL query with parameterized values for security
    insert_query = """
        INSERT INTO patient_vitals (patient_id, temperature, heart_rate, blood_pressure, timestamp)
        VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, NOW())
    """
    
    cursor.execute(insert_query, (
        patient_id, 
        vital_signs['temperature'], 
        vital_signs['heart_rate'],
        vital_signs['blood_pressure']
    ))
    
    # Commit the transaction
    db_connection.commit()
    cursor.close()
```

#### 2. Healthcare Analytics

**Example**: Track hospital readmission rates

```python
def analyze_readmissions(db_connection, time_period_days=30):
    """Analyze patient readmissions within specified time period."""
    cursor = db_connection.cursor()
    
    # SQL query to find readmissions
    query = """
        SELECT 
            COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) as total_patients,
            SUM(CASE WHEN readmit_count > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as readmitted_patients,
            ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN readmit_count > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / 
                  COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) * 100, 2) as readmission_rate
        FROM (
            SELECT 
                patient_id,
                COUNT(admission_id) - 1 as readmit_count
            FROM admissions
            WHERE admission_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL %s DAY
            GROUP BY patient_id
        ) subquery
    """
    
    cursor.execute(query, (time_period_days,))
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    cursor.close()
    
    return {
        'total_patients': result[0],
        'readmitted_patients': result[1],
        'readmission_rate': result[2]
    }
```

#### 3. Medical Research Database

**Example**: Track clinical trial outcomes

```python
def record_trial_outcome(db_connection, trial_id, participant_id, outcome_data):
    """Record outcome data for clinical trial participants."""
    cursor = db_connection.cursor()
    
    insert_query = """
        INSERT INTO trial_outcomes (
            trial_id, participant_id, outcome_measurement, 
            measurement_value, measurement_date
        ) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
    """
    
    cursor.execute(insert_query, (
        trial_id,
        participant_id,
        outcome_data['measurement'],
        outcome_data['value'],
        outcome_data['date']
    ))
    
    db_connection.commit()
    cursor.close()
```

#### 4. Public Health Surveillance

**Example**: Track disease outbreaks geographically

```python
def report_disease_cases(db_connection, disease_id, location_data, case_count):
    """Record new disease cases by geographic location."""
    cursor = db_connection.cursor()
    
    insert_query = """
        INSERT INTO disease_tracking (
            disease_id, location_zip, location_county, 
            location_state, case_count, report_date
        ) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, CURRENT_DATE)
    """
    
    cursor.execute(insert_query, (
        disease_id,
        location_data['zip'],
        location_data['county'],
        location_data['state'],
        case_count
    ))
    
    db_connection.commit()
    cursor.close()
```

## Part 5: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Connection Refused Errors

**Problem**: `Connection refused` error when trying to connect to the database

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Docker containers are running: `docker ps`
2. Check if PostgreSQL port is reachable: `telnet localhost 8700`
3. Ensure environment variables match Docker Compose settings
4. Restart Docker containers: `docker-compose restart`

#### Authentication Failed

**Problem**: `Authentication failed` when connecting to the database

**Solutions**:
1. Double-check username and password in .env file
2. Ensure username/password match docker-compose.yml values
3. Check if PostgreSQL container initialized correctly: `docker logs pgsql_train`

#### Missing Python Dependencies

**Problem**: `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError` when running Python code

**Solutions**:
1. Install required packages: `pip install psycopg2-binary python-dotenv`
2. Check if virtual environment is active (if using one)
3. Verify Python version is 3.12 or later: `python --version`

#### Data Persistence Issues

**Problem**: Data disappears after container restart

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're not using `docker-compose down -v` (which removes volumes)
2. Use `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up -d` to restart containers
3. Check volume configuration in docker-compose.yml
