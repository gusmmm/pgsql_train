    "summary": "This table presents the baseline characteristics for a large cohort of 371,061 peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs), detailing patient demographics, clinical settings, and catheter specifics. The data is stratified into three groups based on catheter dwell time (1-2 days, 3-4 days, and >4 days), allowing for comparison across these durations. Key findings show that patient age and the incidence of bloodstream infections (BSI) increase significantly with longer PIVC dwell times.",
    "context_analysis": "As a typical 'Table 1' in a clinical study, this table serves to describe the baseline characteristics of the study population. Its primary purpose is to establish and compare the different cohorts based on PIVC dwell time, which is a key independent variable. By presenting data on potential confounders like patient age, ICU status, and insertion site, the table provides essential context for the study's main outcome, bloodstream infection (BSI). The clear trend of increasing BSI with longer dwell times directly supports the likely research hypothesis that extended PIVC use is associated with a higher risk of complications.",
    "statistical_findings": "The study includes a large sample of 371,061 PIVCs. A strong positive correlation is observed between PIVC dwell time and both patient age and the incidence of bloodstream infection (BSI). The median age increases from 54 years (IQR 35-73) for PIVCs with a 1-2 day dwell time to 72 years (IQR 55-83) for those with a dwell time over 4 days. Most critically, the rate of BSI increases dramatically with dwell time: from 0.001% (2 cases) in the 1-2 day group to 0.01% (10 cases) in the 3-4 day group, and rising to 0.04% (49 cases) in the >4 day group. PIVCs with longer dwell times were more frequently placed in the forearm (58% for >4d) and less frequently in the hand (19% for >4d) compared to those with shorter dwell times.",
