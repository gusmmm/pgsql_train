    "content": "IMPORTANCE Bloodstream infections (BSIs) associated with peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) are rare but preventable adverse events. The association of dwell time with the risk of BSIs with PIVCs remains controversial.\nOBJECTIVE To analyze the risk of BSIs during PIVC maintenance therapy.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this observational cohort study, all patients hospitalized at Geneva University Hospitals with at least 1 PIVC insertion on the upper extremity (N = 371 061) between January 1, 2016, and February 29, 2020, were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed from January 2023 to January 2025.\nEXPOSURE At least 1 PIVC insertion on the upper extremity.\nMAINOUTCOMESANDMEASURES Theprimary outcome was BSIs with PIVCs; data were collected by prospective BSI surveillance. The daily risk of BSIs with PIVCs was analyzed using the hazard rate function by kernel-based methods. Multivariable logistic models were performed to evaluate the risk of BSIs with PIVCs comparing different cutoff values of dwell times (&gt;3 vs â‰¤ 3 days, &gt;4 vs â‰¤ 4 days, &gt;5 vs â‰¤ 5 days, and &gt;6 vs â‰¤ 6days).\nRESULTS Atotal of 371 061 PIVCs (median patient age, 63 years [IQR, 41-79 years]; 187 786 women [51%]) with documented catheter duration were included. A total of 140 178 PIVCs (38%) had a dwell time of 1 to 2 days, 119 252 (32%) had a dwell time of 3 to 4 days, and 111 631 (30%) had a dwell time of more than 4 days. The instantaneous risk of BSIs with PIVCs was low in the first 2 days of dwell time and increased rapidly thereafter. The risk of BSIs was significantly increased after 3 days of catheter maintenance (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 13.55; 95% CI, 5.44-34.00). This risk was the highest after 3 days and remained increased thereafter (&gt;4 days: AOR, 8.53; 95% CI, 4.47-16.28; &gt;5 days: AOR, 5.38; 95% CI, 3.23-8.96; and &gt;6 days: AOR, 7.63; 95% CI, 4.57-12.74).\nCONCLUSIONSANDRELEVANCE In this cohort study of 371 061 PIVCs, dwell time was associated with the development of BSIs with PIVCs. After day 3, PIVC indication should be reviewed and PIVC replacement considered.\nJAMANetwork Open. 2025;8(4):e257202. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.7202\nOpenAccess.

    "content": "Peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) insertions are frequent among hospitalized patients. A global audit across 13 countries showed that almost 60% of patients had at least 1 PIVC in situ. 1 A pointprevalence study in Switzerland illustrated a similar prevalence, with 49% of patients having a PIVC. 2 The most frequently reported complications associated with PIVCs are phlebitis, hematoma, and extravasation. 3 Few data are available on the risk of bloodstream infections (BSIs) associated with PIVCs. A systematic review showed that the risk of BSIs with PIVCs may be underestimated. 4 Moreover, BSIs with PIVCs are associated with increased mortality and are therefore an important outcome to evaluate PIVC-associated risks. 5 In addition, infection-related costs are substantial. 6,7\nThe role of dwell time in the development of BSIs with PIVCs remains debated. 4 In 2019, a systematic review and meta-analysis illustrated that routine replacement (vs clinically indicated replacement) of PIVCs was not associated with BSIs. 8 However, a recent study challenged these results in a large cohort study with a before-after design including more than 400 000 PIVCs. 9 The study demonstrated that a clinically indicated replacement of PIVCs was associated with an increased risk of BSIs. Here, using the same high-quality database, we analyzed the risk of BSIs with PIVCs during catheter maintenance therapy.",

HUG has approximately 2100 beds and receives 60 000 hospital admissions per year. All pediatric and adult hospitalized patients with at least 1 PIVC insertion on the upper extremity between January 1, 2016, and February 29, 2020 (ie, start of the COVID-19 pandemic), were included. Peripheral intravenous catheters inserted outside of HUG and PIVCs inserted in the lower extremity were excluded. Peripheral intravenous catheters with secured injection sites were used and midlines were not inserted at HUG during the study period. Hospital-acquired BSI surveillance is part of a mandatory indicator surveillance at HUG and thus is considered as quality assurance. Only pseudonymized data have been processed; therefore, ethical board approval for data reuse is not required in accordance with HUG policy.

    "content": "Statistical analysis was performed from January 2023 to January 2025. We described characteristics of PIVCs as counts and percentages for categorical variables or median (IQR) values for numeric variables. The statistical plan had 5 steps. First, we illustrated the number of PIVCs included and BSIs with PIVCs in situ at different dwell times. Second, the daily risk of BSIs with PIVCs was analyzed using the hazard rate function by kernel-based methods, where time was taken as a continuous variable. 12 Third, we described the characteristics of included PIVCs with different dwell times (1-2 days, 3-4 days, and &gt;4 days). Fourth, to investigate when PIVC replacement should be considered, we evaluated the risk of BSIs with PIVCs before vs after different cutoff values of dwell times, using multivariable logistic models. The main variable of interest, dwell time, was dichotomized by selecting a cutoff value and inputted into our multivariable models; other variables, which may be associated with the risk of BSIs with PIVCs, were used as adjustment factors (ie, sex, age, time from hospital admission to PIVC insertion, and insertion site). Several analyses were performed considering different cutoff values (&gt;3 vs â‰¤ 3 days, &gt;4 vs â‰¤ 4days, &gt;5 vs â‰¤ 5 days, and &gt;6 vs â‰¤ 6days). In addition, we performed several sensitivity analyses. We used inverse probability-weighted logistic models (using the covariates age, sex, insertion site, and time from hospital admission to catheter insertion) to investigate the association between different dwell time cutoffs and BSIs with PIVCs (eMethods in Supplement 1). We performed a sensitivity analysis using only PIVCs included during the 'replaced if clinically indicated' period (from April 1, 2018, to October 15, 2019). The analyses assumed independence between PIVCs. To mitigate the bias introduced by multiple PIVC insertions for an individual patient and because a random-effect models did not converge due to the low number of BSIs with PIVCs, we performed a sensitivity analysis limiting only to the first PIVC inserted for a patient.\nFifth, to evaluate the infectious risk for different dwell times, we performed additional analyses using multivariable logistic models (adjustment factors were sex, age, time from hospital admission to PIVC insertion, and insertion site), considering the dwell time as a categorical variable (4 days, 5 days, â‰¥ 6days) and using 3 days or less as reference.\nTests were 2-tailed, with P &lt; .05 being considered statistically significant.

    "content": "Using a large prospective database and including more than 370 000 PIVCs, we found that the dwell time is associated with the development of BSIs with PIVCs. The infectious risk increased sharply at the third insertion day and remained high compared with short dwell times. Most BSIs with PIVCs occurred after 4 days of dwell time.\nProbably due to their low incidence, BSIs with PIVCs are rarely investigated and only few studies have focused on this outcome, which is associated with increased mortality. 13 However, considering the widespread use of PIVCs among hospitalized patients, the burden of BSIs with PIVCs is not negligible. There is a need for more high-quality studies on effective preventive measures for PIVC management. 14 The World Health Organization has recently published guidelines for prevention of BSIs with PIVCs. 15 Regarding the risk of BSIs with PIVCs based on PIVC dwell time, data in the literature are scant and controversial. One study that included surgical patients with a PIVC showed that there was no difference in dwell time among those with and without a BSI. 16 Another study from the 1980s observed that among 17 BSIs with PIVCs with known duration of catheterization, 15 episodes involved PIVCs in place 3 or more days. 17 In 1994, Fry et al 18 found that almost 50% of BSIs with PIVCs occurred with dwell times of more than 4 days. A monocentric study including PIVCs from 2002to2006showedthattwo-thirds of BSIs with PIVCs involved PIVCs with a dwell time of 4 days or more. 19 In 2013, Freixas et al 20 showed that among intravascular catheter infections originating from PIVCs, more than 60% occurred 72 hours after catheter insertion. On one hand, these analyses were mostly monocentric, retrospective, and conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, likely representing studies performed in the era before infection preventive bundles were routinely implemented. In this context, it is conceivable that most current state-of-the-art prevention measures were not routinely implemented. 21 Onthe other hand, data from randomized clinical trials that compared routine replacement vs clinically indicated replacement did not provide relevant answers. Indeed, they did not assess the daily risk of infection due (1) to the low number of BSIs with PIVCs included and (2) to the difficulty to randomize patients with different dwell times. 8 In an environment where BSIs with PIVCs were prospectively followed up, probably representing one of the largest datasets assembled, we founf that dwell time was associated with the occurrence of BSIs with PIVCs. We observed that the daily risk increased constantly after 2 days of catheter maintenance, thus highlighting the need of strong prevention measures (ie, routine replacement) to avoid infectious complications. We observed the highest risk of BSIs with PIVCs for dwell times of more than 3 days compared with shorter dwell times and found that 80% of BSIs with PIVCs occurred after day 4. We observed that coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently identified microorganisms for PIVCs with dwell time of more than 4 days, as well as a trend toward an increased proportion of S aureus BSIs for PIVCs with dwell time of more than 4 days. We also observed a similar proportion of gram-negative bacteria for PIVCs with a dwell time of 4 days or fewer and a dwell time of more than 4 days.\nOur results have important clinical implications; it is conceivable that after day 3, the indication of PIVC maintenance therapy should be challenged and PIVC replacement at least considered and, at day 4, replacement should be routinely performed. Other preventive measures aimed at reducing extraluminal PIVC contaminations (eg, antimicrobial impregnated dressing) and allowing prolonged PIVC catheterization could be considered. However, to our knowledge, such additional prevention strategies were investigated only in peripheral arterial catheters or central venous catheters and are not currently recommended for PIVCs. 22\n(Reprinted)",

    "title": "Limitations",
    "content": "Our study has several limitations. First, this was a single-center study, limiting the generalizability of the results; however, HUG is composed of several different sites, thus increasing the diversity of the patient population. Second, we conducted an observational study without access to some clinical data (eg, disease severity, experience of the operator); however, we adjusted our analyses for several covariates that were electronically extracted. Third, due to the low incidence of BSIs with PIVCs, mixed logistic models, which take into account several PIVCs for an individual patient, did not converge. Therefore, all of our models assumed independence between PIVCs. To reduce this potential bias, we performed a sensitivity analysis that considered only the first PIVC inserted during the hospitalization, which showed similar results. Fourth, our models did not consider other important outcomes that may compete with BSIs with PIVCs (eg, mortality and phlebitis). Fifth, we did not observe BSIs with PIVCs among pediatric patients, and our results can be generalized only to the adult population. Sixth, further cost-effectiveness analyses should be conducted to provide more information about the ideal time at which a PIVC should be replaced.",

    "content": "The results of this cohort study using a large prospective surveillance database suggest that dwell time is associated with the development of BSIs with PIVCs. The infectious risk increased after 3 days of dwell time compared with shorter catheter duration and most BSIs were identified after 4 days of dwell time. Based on these results, PIVC maintenance therapy should be challenged at day 3 and PIVC replacement should be at least considered; PIVC replacement should be performed at day 4.",
